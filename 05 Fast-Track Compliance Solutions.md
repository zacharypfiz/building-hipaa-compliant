## **AWS Compliance Services**

AWS provides several services designed to help startups establish and maintain HIPAA compliance. These services offer automated setups and built-in compliance features, significantly reducing the complexity and time required.


### **AWS Control Tower**

Simplifies the setup and governance of a secure, multi-account AWS environment using best practices. Ideal for users who prefer a managed, out-of-the-box solution with automated setup and ongoing management.

**Key Features:**



* **Pre-configured Landing Zone**: Automatically sets up a secure baseline environment using AWS best practices.
* **Guardrails**: Provides a set of mandatory and elective guardrails that enforce policies across your AWS accounts.
* **Dashboard**: Offers a centralized dashboard to monitor compliance and the status of guardrails.
* **Automated Account Provisioning**: Simplifies the creation and configuration of new AWS accounts within the organization.

It establishes the secure infrastructure and governance needed for compliance, but doesn't handle detailed policy management, employee training, or specific application-level compliance tasks.


### **AWS Landing Zone Accelerator**

Provides a customizable framework for setting up a secure, multi-account AWS environment with a focus on compliance and scalability. Suitable for organizations that need a high degree of customization and flexibility in their AWS environment setup.
