## **HIPAA Privacy Rule**

The HIPAA Privacy Rule protects all "individually identifiable health information" held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule calls this information "protected health information (PHI)."

"Individually identifiable health information" is information, including demographic data, that relates to:



* the individual's past, present or future physical or mental health or condition,
* the provision of health care to the individual, or
* the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual,

and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. It includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).


### 1. **Use and Disclosure of PHI**

A covered entity may not use or disclose protected health information, except when permitted.



* As the Privacy Rule permits or requires
* As the individual who is the subject of the information (or the individual's personal representative) authorizes in writing.


### Permitted Uses and Disclosures for Entities



* **To the Individual**: PHI can be disclosed to the individual it pertains to.
* **For Treatment, Payment, and Healthcare Operations**: PHI can be used and disclosed as necessary for these activities.
* **Incidental Use or Disclosure**: Allowed if it is a byproduct of an otherwise permitted use or disclosure, provided that minimum necessary standards and safeguards are in place.
* **With Authorization**: PHI can be disclosed if the individual (or the individual's personal representative) has provided a valid authorization.
* **Under Special Circumstances**: Permitted by specific agreements or situations such as public health activities, law enforcement, and research, provided certain conditions are met.


### Valid Authorization for Use or Disclosure of PHI



* **Description of Information**: Clearly describe the PHI to be used or disclosed, making it specific and meaningful.
* **Authorized Persons**: Identify the person(s) or class of persons authorized to make the requested use or disclosure.
* **Recipient Identification**: Identify the person(s) or class of persons to whom the PHI may be disclosed.
* **Purpose of Disclosure**: Describe the purpose of the use or disclosure. If the individual initiates the authorization, "at the request of the individual" is sufficient.
* **Expiration**: Include an expiration date or event. For research, terms like “end of the research study” or “none” are acceptable.
* **Signature and Date**: Obtain the individual’s signature and date. If signed by a personal representative, include a description of their authority.
* **Right to Revoke**: Inform the individual of their right to revoke the authorization in writing, along with exceptions and how to revoke it, or refer to the entity’s notice of privacy practices.
* **Conditioning of Authorization**: State whether the entity can condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or eligibility for benefits on the authorization. If prohibited, indicate so. If allowed, explain the consequences of refusing to sign.
* **Potential for Redisclosure**: Notify the individual that information disclosed per the authorization may be redisclosed by the recipient and may no longer be protected under HIPAA.
* **Plain Language**: Write the authorization in plain language to ensure clarity and understanding.
* **Copy to Individual**: Provide the individual with a copy of the signed authorization.
* **Marketing with Financial Remuneration**: If the authorization involves marketing with financial remuneration from a third party, state that such remuneration is involved.
* **Sale of PHI**: If the authorization is for the sale of PHI, it must state that the disclosure will result in remuneration to the entity.


### Covered Entities: Required Disclosures



* **To the Individual**: When requested, individuals have the right to access their PHI and receive an accounting of disclosures.
* **To the Secretary of HHS**: For compliance investigations or enforcement actions.


### Business Associates: Permitted Uses and Disclosures



* **As Specified in Contracts**: Business associates may use or disclose PHI as permitted by their business associate contracts.
* **For Legal Compliance**: Use or disclosure as required by law.


### Business Associates: Required Uses and Disclosures



1. **To the Secretary of HHS**: For compliance investigations or enforcement actions.
2. **To Covered Entities or Individuals**: As necessary to fulfill a covered entity’s obligations regarding individuals' access to PHI.


### Prohibited Uses and Disclosures



1. **Genetic Information**: Cannot be used for underwriting purposes.
2. **Sale of PHI**: PHI cannot be sold without explicit authorization, except under certain conditions such as for public health or research purposes, where only reasonable cost-based fees are received.


### Minimum Necessary Standard

When using, disclosing, or requesting PHI, covered entities and business associates must ensure that only the minimum necessary information is involved to accomplish the intended purpose.

**Exceptions**

The minimum necessary standard does not apply to:



1. Disclosures to or requests by healthcare providers for treatment.
2. Uses or disclosures made to the individual.
3. Uses or disclosures made pursuant to a valid authorization.
4. Disclosures to the Secretary of HHS for compliance and enforcement.
5. Uses or disclosures required by law.
6. Uses or disclosures required for HIPAA compliance.

**Implementation Specifications**



* **Minimum Necessary Uses:**
    * Identify workforce members who need access to PHI to perform their duties.
    * Limit access to PHI based on the identified need.
* **Minimum Necessary Disclosures:**
    * For routine disclosures, implement policies that limit PHI to the minimum necessary.
    * For non-routine disclosures, develop and apply criteria to limit PHI and review each request individually.
* **Minimum Necessary Requests:**
    * Limit requests for PHI to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose.
    * For routine requests, implement standard protocols.
    * For non-routine requests, develop criteria and review each request individually.
* **Reliance on Requests:**
    * Entities can reasonably rely on the requesting party's representation that the information requested is the minimum necessary when:
        * Disclosing to public officials for permitted purposes.
        * Disclosing to another covered entity.
        * Disclosing to a professional providing services, who represents the minimum necessary.
        * Disclosing for research purposes, with appropriate documentation.


### Uses and Disclosures of PHI Subject to Agreed Upon Restriction



* **Agreement to Restrictions**: Document and honor any agreed restrictions on PHI.
* **Compliance**: Do not use or disclose PHI in violation of the agreed restrictions.
* **Exceptions**: Follow specific HIPAA exceptions allowing certain uses or disclosures despite restrictions.


### Creating De-Identified Information



* **Usage**: Covered entities can use Protected Health Information (PHI) to create de-identified information, which is not subject to HIPAA rules.
* **Disclosure**: PHI can be disclosed to a business associate for the purpose of creating de-identified information, whether or not the de-identified information will be used by the covered entity.

To ensure health information is not individually identifiable and thus not subject to HIPAA rules, entities can de-identify PHI using one of two methods:

1. **Expert Determination Method**

A qualified expert applies statistical and scientific principles to determine that the risk of identifying individuals is very small. This involves:



* **Risk Assessment**: An expert evaluates the risk of re-identification and determines it is minimal.
* **Documentation**: The expert documents the methods and results of the analysis justifying this determination.

2. **Safe Harbor Method**

This involves removing specific identifiers from the PHI to ensure it cannot be used to identify an individual. The identifiers to be removed include:



* **Names**
* **Geographic Information**: All subdivisions smaller than a state, such as street address, city, county, and zip code. The first three digits of a zip code can be used if the combined area includes more than 20,000 people, otherwise, the digits must be changed to 000.
* **Dates**: All date elements (except the year) related to the individual, such as birth, admission, discharge, and death dates. For individuals over 89, their age and any related date elements must be aggregated into a single category of 90 or older.
* **Contact Information**: Telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses.
* **Identification Numbers**: Social security numbers, medical record numbers, health plan beneficiary numbers, account numbers, certificate/license numbers.
* **Vehicle and Device Identifiers**: Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, device identifiers and serial numbers.
* **Online Identifiers**: Web URLs, IP addresses.
* **Biometric Identifiers**: Fingerprints, voice prints.
* **Images**: Full-face photographs and any comparable images.
* **Other Identifiers**: Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code.

Additionally, the covered entity must not have actual knowledge that the information could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify an individual.


### Using De-Identified Information



* **Post-De-Identification**: Once information is de-identified, it is considered not individually identifiable and is no longer subject to HIPAA regulations.
* **Safeguarding Re-Identification Codes**: If a code or other method is used to re-identify the information, it must be kept secure and not disclosed.
* **Conditions for Re-Identified Information**: If de-identified information is re-identified, it can only be used or disclosed according to HIPAA rules.


### Re-identification

An entity may assign a code or other means of record identification to allow information de-identified under this section to be re-identified by the entity, provided that:



* **Derivation**: The code or other means of record identification is not derived from or related to information about the individual and is not otherwise capable of being translated so as to identify the individual.
* **Security**: The entity does not use or disclose the code or other means of record identification for any other purpose, and does not disclose the mechanism for re-identification.


### Disclosures to Business Associates

Covered entities can disclose PHI to business associates and allow them to create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on their behalf if they obtain satisfactory assurances that the business associate will safeguard the information. Business associates can further disclose PHI to subcontractors under similar conditions. These assurances must be documented through a written contract or agreement.


### Deceased Individuals

Entities must comply with HIPAA requirements for the PHI of deceased individuals for 50 years following their death.


### Personal Representatives

Entities must treat a personal representative as the individual for HIPAA purposes:



* **Adults and Emancipated Minors**: If someone has legal authority to act on behalf of an adult or emancipated minor, they must be treated as the personal representative.
* **Unemancipated Minors**: Generally, parents or guardians act as personal representatives unless:
    * The minor consents to the healthcare service and no other consent is required by law.
    * The minor may obtain the healthcare service without parental consent and consents to the service themselves.
    * A confidentiality agreement between the provider and the minor exists.
* **Deceased Individuals**: Executors or administrators of the deceased's estate act as personal representatives.
* **Abuse, Neglect, Endangerment Situations**: If treating a person as the personal representative could endanger the individual, the covered entity may choose not to treat them as such.


### Confidential Communications

Covered entities must comply with requests for confidential communication of PHI, ensuring that communication methods protect the individual's privacy.


### Uses and Disclosures Consistent with Notice

Entities must not use or disclose PHI in ways inconsistent with their privacy notice. Specific activities listed in the notice require a clear statement to be included.


### Disclosures by Whistleblowers and Workforce Member Crime Victims



* **Whistleblowers**: Workforce members or business associates can disclose PHI if they believe the covered entity is violating laws or professional standards, or if the conditions provided by the entity endanger individuals.
* **Crime Victims**: Workforce members who are victims of a crime can disclose PHI about the perpetrator to law enforcement.

## **HIPAA Security Rule**

The HIPAA Security Rule protects electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). It requires covered entities and business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure ePHI's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Specifically, they must:



* Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI they create, receive, maintain or transmit;
* Identify and protect against reasonably anticipated threats to the security or integrity of the information;
* Protect against reasonably anticipated, impermissible uses or disclosures; and
* Ensure compliance by their workforce.

The rule is flexible and scalable, allowing entities to tailor security measures to their specific needs based on their size, complexity, and resources.


### Key Considerations for Security Measures



* Size, complexity, and capabilities
* Technical, hardware, and software infrastructure
* Costs of security measures
* Likelihood and impact of potential risks to ePHI

Covered entities and business associates must regularly review and update their security measures to protect ePHI in a changing environment.


### Standard vs. Addressable Specifications

Businesses under HIPAA must comply with every Security Rule "Standard." Implementation specifications are categorized as either "required" or "addressable."



* **Required Specifications**: Must be implemented without exception.
* **Addressable Specifications**: Must assess each implementation specification for its reasonableness and appropriateness in protecting ePHI. If appropriate, it should be implemented; if not, the entity must document the reasons and implement an equivalent alternative. Additionally, security measures must be reviewed and modified as needed to ensure ongoing protection of ePHI, with documentation updated accordingly.

    * **Availability**: Make documentation available to personnel responsible for implementing procedures.
    * **Updates**: Periodically review and update documentation as needed in response to environmental or operational changes affecting ePHI security.


## **HIPAA Breach Notification Rule**

The Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities and business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured PHI. Notifications must be sent to affected individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and, in certain cases, the media.



* **Definition of Breach**: Unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI that compromises its security or privacy. Exceptions include:
    * Unintentional access by employees.
    * Inadvertent disclosures between authorized individuals.
    * Instances where there is a low probability that the PHI has been compromised.
* **Notification Requirements:**
    * Notify affected individuals within 60 days of discovering the breach.
    * Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS annually.
    * Breaches affecting 500 or more individuals require immediate notification to both HHS and the media.


### Notification to Individuals



* **Timeliness of notification**: Without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 days after discovery.
* **Content of notification:**
    * A brief description of what happened, including dates of the breach and its discovery, if known.
    * A description of the types of unsecured PHI that were involved in the breach.
    * Any steps individuals should take to protect themselves from potential harm resulting from the breach.
    * Actions taken by the entity to investigate, mitigate harm to individuals, and prevent further breaches.
    * Contact information for further inquiries, which shall include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, Web site, or postal address.
    * Written in plain language.
* **Methods of individual notification**: 
    * **Written Notice**: First-class mail or email (if agreed upon by the individual). If the entity knows the individual is deceased and has the address of the next of kin or personal representative, they must send a written notification by first-class mail to that person. The notification may be provided in one or more mailings as information is available.
    * **Substitute Notice**: If contact information is insufficient or outdated:
        * **For fewer than 10 individuals**: Alternative written notice, phone, or other means.
        * **For 10 or more individuals**: Conspicuous posting on the entity’s website for 90 days or notice in major print or broadcast media. Must include a toll-free number active for at least 90 days.
    * **Urgent Situations**: Phone or other means for immediate threats. In addition to standard procedures.


### Notification to the Media



* **Standard**: Notify prominent media outlets for breaches involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction.
* **Timeliness**: Without unreasonable delay, no later than 60 days after discovery.
* **Content**: Same as required for individual notifications.


### Notification to the Secretary



* **Standard**: Notify the HHS Secretary following the discovery of a breach.
* **Breaches Involving 500 or More Individuals**: Notify contemporaneously with individual notices.
* **Breaches Involving Fewer than 500 Individuals**: Maintain a log and report to HHS within 60 days after the end of the calendar year.


### Notification by a Business Associate



* **General Rule**: Notify the covered entity of breaches.
* **Discovery**: A breach is considered discovered on the first day the business associate knows or should have known about it.
* **Timeliness**: Notify the covered entity without unreasonable delay, no later than 60 days after discovery.
* **Content**: Identify affected individuals and provide any other required information.


### Law Enforcement Delay



* **Delay Request**: If law enforcement states that notification would impede an investigation or harm national security:
    * **Written Request**: Delay for the specified period.
    * **Oral Request**: Temporarily delay for up to 30 days unless a written request is provided.


### Administrative Requirements and Burden of Proof



* **Compliance**: Adhere to specific administrative requirements.
* **Burden of Proof**: Demonstrate that all required notifications were made or that the use/disclosure did not constitute a breach.


## **HITECH Act and its Impact on HIPAA**

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted in 2009, strengthened HIPAA regulations by promoting the adoption of health information technology and enhancing privacy and security protections for ePHI.


### Key Aspects



* **Increased Penalties**: HITECH increased the penalties for non-compliance, with tiered penalties ranging from $100 to $50,000 per violation based on the level of negligence, up to a maximum annual penalty of $1.5 million per violation category.
* **Breach Notification**: Expanded the breach notification requirements, making it mandatory for business associates to notify covered entities of breaches.
* **Audits**: Authorized periodic audits by HHS to ensure compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements and to enforce penalties more aggressively.
* **Business Associates**: Made business associates directly liable for compliance with certain HIPAA Privacy and Security Rule requirements.
* **Promotion of Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**: Encouraged adoption of EHRs, which increased the digital footprint and potential vulnerability of health data.

While these measures aimed to enhance the protection of health information, the increased penalties and rigorous compliance requirements were seen by some as burdensome and potentially stifling innovation in the healthcare sector, especially for smaller entities and startups.


## **Omnibus Rule**

The Omnibus Rule, enacted in 2013, significantly strengthened HIPAA's privacy and security protections and extended compliance requirements to business associates and their subcontractors.


### Key Aspects



* **Expanded Scope**: Expands the definition of a business associate to include any entity handling PHI on behalf of a covered entity and their subcontractors. Business associates and subcontractors are now directly liable for HIPAA compliance.
* **Breach Notification**: Introduces an objective standard for breach notification.
* **Enhanced Patient Rights**: Patients can now request electronic copies of their medical records, and restrict PHI disclosures to health plans if they pay out-of-pocket.
* **Tighter Restrictions on Marketing and Sales**: Stricter rules on using and disclosing PHI for marketing and fundraising. Prohibits selling PHI without individual authorization, with limited exceptions.
* **Stronger Enforcement**: Reinforced the penalty structure introduced by HITECH, applying it to both covered entities and business associates.


## **HIPAA Safe Harbor Act**

The HIPAA Safe Harbor Act, signed into law in 2021, reduces penalties for HIPAA violations for organizations that implement recognized security practices. It was partly motivated by the challenges healthcare organizations faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the critical need for strong healthcare systems and accelerated innovation in health technology.


### Key Aspects



* **Recognition of Security Practices**: Encourages the adoption of recognized security practices, such as those outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
* **Reduced Penalties**: Organizations demonstrating compliance with recognized security practices can face reduced penalties in the event of a HIPAA violation.
* **Ongoing Security Improvements**: Motivates organizations to continuously improve their security measures and maintain a high standard of data protection.


### Impact on Healthcare Businesses

For healthcare businesses, the Safe Harbor Act balances stringent data protection requirements with the practical realities of running a business. It offers reduced penalties for those who proactively implement strong security measures. This acknowledges that cyberattacks can occur even with the best practices. The Act encourages organizations to maintain high security standards without fearing excessively punitive measures. This is particularly beneficial for startups concerned about the high costs and risks associated with HIPAA compliance under the HITECH Act.


## **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**

A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is a contract between a HIPAA-covered entity and a business associate. The BAA ensures that the business associate will appropriately safeguard PHI.


### Key components of a BAA



* **Scope and Purpose**: Defines permissible uses and disclosures of PHI by the business associate, ensuring PHI is only used as outlined in the agreement.
* **Safeguards**: Requires the business associate to implement administrative, physical, and technical measures to protect PHI, aligning with HIPAA’s Security Rule.
* **Breach Reporting**: Mandates the business associate to report any breaches of PHI to the covered entity without unreasonable delay, but no later than 60 days after discovery.
* **Subcontractors**: Requires business associates to obtain similar assurances through BAAs with their subcontractors who handle PHI, ensuring downstream compliance.
* **Termination**: Outlines the conditions under which the agreement can be terminated if the business associate violates a material term of the contract.

Any business partner handling PHI must sign a BAA and become a business associate with the entity that is the source of the information. Covered entities need BAAs with all such business associates. Additionally, business associates must sign BAAs with any subcontractors who handle PHI on their behalf.

BAAs create a downstream chain of accountability, ensuring that everyone handling PHI is responsible for protecting it and complying with HIPAA regulations.
