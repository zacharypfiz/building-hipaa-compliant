### Higher Standards and Alignment

While there is no HIPAA certification for cloud service providers, AWS aligns its HIPAA risk management program with FedRAMP and NIST 800-53, higher security standards that correspond to the HIPAA Security Rule. [NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/66/r2/final) outlines how these standards align with HIPAA requirements.


### **AWS Services for HIPAA-Compliant Applications**

AWS offers several key services for building HIPAA-compliant applications. Some of these services can be used without PHI, while others are designed to securely handle PHI.


### Steps to Use PHI with AWS Services



1. **Check HIPAA Eligibility**: Confirm that the AWS service you plan to use is listed as one of the [HIPAA Eligible Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/).
2. **Enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**: Before using any of these services with PHI, you must first enter into an AWS Business Associate Agreement.


### Key Services

The exact needs of every system is different, but these are some common AWS services that help build a robust, HIPAA-compliant infrastructure:



* **AWS CloudTrail**: Tracks user activity and API usage with detailed logs, crucial for security auditing and compliance monitoring.

* **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**: Provides centralized key management and audit logging, ensuring secure data encryption and key management.


### Encryption and Protection of PHI in AWS

AWS offers a whitepaper, [“Architecting for HIPAA Security and Compliance on Amazon Web Services,”](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/architecting-hipaa-security-and-compliance-on-aws/) which covers encryption and protection of PHI along with auditing, backups, and disaster recovery using AWS services.

The HIPAA Security Rule mandates the protection of PHI both in transit and at rest. While encryption is an addressable specification under HIPAA, AWS requires customers to encrypt PHI using HIPAA-eligible services, following guidance from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS):



* **Encryption Requirements**:
    * **Data in Transit**: Must comply with NIST guidelines such as SP 800-52 (TLS), SP 800-77 (IPsec VPNs), SP 800-113 (SSL VPNs), or FIPS 140-2 validated.
    * **Data at Rest**: Must follow NIST SP 800-111 for storage encryption technologies.
    * **Media Sanitization**: Media must be destroyed according to NIST SP 800-88 guidelines to ensure PHI is irretrievable.
* **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**:
    * **Key Management**: AWS KMS simplifies managing and auditing encryption keys.
    * **Flexibility**: Customers have the flexibility to meet encryption requirements using various AWS services and patterns, as they have a comprehensive suite of HIPAA-eligible services that support encryption and key management.
* **HHS Guidance**:
    * AWS’s Business Associate Agreement (BAA) mandates that PHI encryption must align with HHS guidance to render PHI unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals.


### Auditing, Backups, and Disaster Recovery

HIPAA’s Security Rule has detailed requirements related to in-depth auditing capabilities, data backup procedures, and disaster recovery mechanisms. AWS provides numerous services to help customers meet these requirements:



* **Auditing**:
    * **Activity Logs**: Use Amazon EC2 to track detailed activity logs, including who accessed data, IP addresses, and what data was accessed.
    * **Centralized Logging**: Store logs in Amazon S3 for long-term, reliable storage and easy access during audits.
    * **Granular Audits**: Run activity log files and audits down to the packet layer on virtual servers.

### **Architecting for Security and Compliance**

The HIPAA Security Rule mandates specific requirements to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. Following the guidance provided in [NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/66/r2/final), "Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule: A Cybersecurity Resource Guide," offers detailed instructions on how to fulfill these requirements.


### Key Activities

The tables in [NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/66/r2/final) outline key activities for each HIPAA Security Rule standard, designed to guide the implementation of these requirements. Key activities are actions associated with the security functions suggested by each standard. Some are identified as implementation specifications, either required or addressable, while others, though not explicitly required by HIPAA, contribute to a robust security process.

Each table starts with the standard's name and description, followed by a list of key activities, highlighting implementation specifications. Standards are categorized into those with detailed implementation instructions and those without, like Assigned Security Responsibility and Evaluation, which serve as their own specifications. The tables also include illustrative activities to ensure a comprehensive security process, emphasizing the need for regulated entities to identify, implement, and document necessary activities tailored to their environments.

These tables introduce the security topics of the HIPAA Security Rule, with more detailed information available in the crosswalk in Appendix D, which links each standard to relevant NIST publications for additional context.
